## What exactly is PokeAlarm?
PokeAlarm is an easy to use yet highly configurable webserver designed to receive webhook data (via POST requests) from a scanner. PokeAlarm then filters data, and relays it into one of your favorite online services such as Discord, Twitter, and more. With PokeAlarm, you'll instantly know about every rare spawn or legendary raid that spawns on your scanners. It's highly configurable, allowing the user to define custom messages and filter alerts based on numerous criteria.
